edge cases:
- no components dir?
- no projects yet.

next steps:
  - add file
  - delete file
  - copy file
  - name/rename



REVISIT:
- directoryEntry path. should it include root components dir?
- how about path relative to project dir, i.e. project/src/index.js, where full root path is components/project/src/index.js 
- set_component_file: TODO: send payload 'file' as relative to project dir.

editor:

  labels:
    - file explorer 
    - editor window (current file's full path)
  
  defaults:
  - build a page for no file loaded.
  - save last file path accessed in local storage, try that.
  - if no components dir, or it's empty and no flat file selected? 
    - direct them to docs and to create a project.

  saving state:
  - last file opened
  - directory open/close config?

file management:
ui:
  - add directory *
  - add file
  ways to add new file:
    1. hover on directory (+) will add a new child file.
      that is an input that shows up.
    2. top-level menu.

  active file should be highlighted.
  way to delete file.
  rename file.
  save file content. 
    - CTRL S should save
    - button for saving.
    - disable saving if file didn't change?

write function to set default file for editor
- or should there be a default?

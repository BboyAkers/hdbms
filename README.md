## Hello world

Follow these steps to create a simple UI to interact with your HarperDB instance.

1. In your terminal, clone the UI scaffold, enter the directory, and install dependencies.
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/harperdb/hdbms.git
    cd hdbms
    npm i -s
    ```

1. Start the project.
    ```
    npm start
    ```

1. Visit the project at http://localhost:3000.
    - The development web server uses a self-signed certificate, and you may see a warning about the site being insecure. In your local development environment, it is safe to click "Advanced" > "proceed to site anyway."

1. Log into the mock instances with admin/Abc1234!

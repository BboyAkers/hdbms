# HarperDB Management Studio (HDBMS)
The easiest way to engage with HarperDB.


## Whatâ€™s in the box

- [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) site scaffold
- [react-router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/) for navigation
- [webpack 4](https://webpack.js.org/) module bundling and development webserver


## Getting Started

1. In your terminal, clone the Studio repo, enter the directory, and install dependencies.
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/harperdb/hdbms.git hdbms
    cd my-project
    npm i -s
    ```

1. Start the project.
    ```
    npm start
    ```

1. Visit the project at http://localhost:3000.

1. Log in using the username and password you provided when installing HarperDB.

- **This version of HarperDB Studio assumes you're running HarperDB on the same computer as the studio, and on port 9925.**

## What's next?

Once you're logged in, you'll be able to add and delete schemas and tables, view and edit table data, and... well, that's about it for v1.

Future additions will include:

- Log into, manage, and store multiple instances of HarperDB
- Register HarperDB to an Enterprise License
- Configure data replication between instances and perfect your data fabric
